The program first registers separate signal handlers for SIGTERM and SIGINT using the signal() function.
The parent process then creates two child processes using fork().
The first child sleeps for five seconds and sends a SIGTERM signal to the parent process.
The second child sleeps for ten seconds and sends a SIGINT signal to the parent process.
The parent process runs indefinitely using an infinite loop with pause() and reacts only when a signal is received.
Upon receiving SIGTERM, the parent prints a message and continues running, while receiving SIGINT causes the parent to print a message and exit gracefully.
