The script accepts a directory path as input and ensures that both the target directory and the backup directory exist by creating them if necessary.
The process ID of the main script is printed using the $$ variable.
Each file in the target directory is moved to the backup directory using the mv command executed in the background with &.
The process ID of each background move operation is captured and displayed using the $! variable.
The wait command is used to pause the script until all background file move processes have completed.
