The script reads the marks.txt file line by line using a while loop and separates each line into roll number, name, and three subject marks using the comma as a delimiter.
For every student, a variable fail_count is initialized to zero and is incremented whenever a subject mark is less than the passing mark of 33.
Conditional statements are used to check each subject mark and update the failure count using arithmetic operations.
If the failure count is exactly one, the student is printed under the “failed in exactly one subject” category and the corresponding counter is increased.
If the failure count is zero, the student is considered to have passed all subjects and the pass counter is updated.
At the end of execution, the script prints the total number of students in each category.
