First, a sample log file was created using the vi editor to provide input data containing INFO, WARNING, and ERROR log entries.
Then, a shell script was written to accept the log file name as a command-line argument and check whether the file exists and is readable.
The script counts the total number of log entries using wc -l and counts INFO, WARNING, and ERROR messages using grep.
The most recent ERROR message is obtained by filtering ERROR logs and selecting the last entry.
After displaying the results on the terminal, the script generates a summary report file named logsummary_<date>.txt.
Error handling is implemented to display meaningful messages when the input is missing or invalid.
