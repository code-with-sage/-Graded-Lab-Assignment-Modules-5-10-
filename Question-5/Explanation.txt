The script first checks whether both directories exist to prevent execution errors.
It lists files in dirA and checks whether each file is missing in dirB to identify files present only in dirA.
The same logic is applied in reverse to find files that exist only in dirB.
For files with the same name in both directories, the cmp -s command is used to compare file contents without producing output.
Based on the exit status of cmp, the script prints whether the file contents match or differ.
No files are copied or modified during the comparison process.
