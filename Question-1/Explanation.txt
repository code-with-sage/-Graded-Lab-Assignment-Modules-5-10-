I used vi editor to create and open the shell script file analyze.sh which is used for editing file from terminal.
In the script first condition is checking that only one argument is given, if not then it show error message.
Next condition check whether the given path is exist or not before going further.
If input is a file then script use wc command to count number of lines, words and characters.
If input is a directory then script use find command to count total files and number of .txt files.
I saved the file and exit from vi editor using :wq command.
After that I used chmod command to give execute permission to the script so it can run from terminal.
Finally I tested the script with file, directory and wrong input and script give correct output and proper error message.
