The script first checks whether the input file emails.txt exists to avoid runtime errors.
The grep -E command is used with a regular expression to match valid email addresses that contain only letters and digits before @, letters after @, and end with .com.
All matching email addresses are redirected into valid.txt.
The sort and uniq commands are then used together to remove duplicate entries from the valid email list.
The grep -v command extracts all lines that do not match the valid email pattern and stores them in invalid.txt.
Redirection is used throughout the script to write the filtered results into separate output files.
